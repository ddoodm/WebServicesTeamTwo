    <d:review id="3" hotel="2" author="3" title="A Worthwhile Inn" rating="5" date="2015-10-20">
    	I took a vacation to NYC a few months ago and stayed at the Brilliant Inn. It certainly is not too spectacular, but it should do the trick for low-budget visitors.

    	This is an incredible capsule hotel right in the middle of Tokyo. It is ideal for hard working businessmen who have found themselves far from home late at night.
